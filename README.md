Wondrous
========
I was travelling home reading GEB and came across the Wondrous property of a number.

I thought it would be fun to try and code up a recursive program to work out the wondrous property of a number before the flight ended.

It can be found at the bottom of page 400 in the 20th anniversary edition, the chapter is named "Aria with Diverse Variation".

The property:
	1) Begin with a number
	2) If it is odd, triple it and add 1.
		if it is even, half it.
	3) Repeat this until the number reaches 1, if it reaches 1 a number is wondrous, if not it is Unwondrous.
